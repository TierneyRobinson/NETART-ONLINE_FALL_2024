    <p class="curtext">Curatorial text:</p>
    <p class="curtext"> While trying to look at old nostalgic webpages, I stumbled across AuctionWeb, a website which is no longer here with us as AuctionWeb, but as eBay. I was shocked to see its transformation. The origins of this influential website are unseen by most and lost due to the evolution of the web. Most importantly, I was in awe of its impact.
        <br>
        <br>
        In this exhibition, l will take the original structure of AuctionWeb and present it in a different light using different net artwork to emphasize transformation, meaning, images of popular websites and their evolution throughout the years such as eBay, Apple, CNN, and Yahoo -- which were present in 1995, the year AuctionWeb was launched -- and how they evolved into what they are today. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I also plan on focusing on NetArt which speaks to the withering of webpages which outdate today's technology and NetArts influence on social impact.</p>
